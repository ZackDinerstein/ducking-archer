<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>I'm a professional designer and creative consultant currently residing in New York City, during my time here I have worked for a range of companies both large and small. The majority of my clients have been in the fashion and non-profit sector, providing me great insight into creating adaptive designs that resonate with the appropriate target audiences.</p>

<p>My goal when I design something is for it to inspire, engage, and inform, while still maintaining a unique look and feel. I am always attempting to push boundaries and incorporate the latest technologies and practices into all that I create. I am creative, reliable, hard-working designer who can work well in a collaborative team environment or individually. I work well with clients and consider myself a strong communicator, presenter, and listener. My career goals are to continue to learn and grow as a graphic designer while utilizing my creativity, knowledge, education and people skills.</p>
